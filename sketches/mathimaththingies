Sphere:

discriminant = y^2 - 4xz

if (discriminant < 0)
	rtn -1
else
	rtn -y - sqrt(y^2 - 4xz) / 2x

x = b*b
y = 2b * (A - C)
z = (A - C) * (A - C) - r^2

C == center of sphere
r == radius of sphere

A == origin of ray
b == direction of ray


Plane:

denom = b * n

if (denom > 0.000001)
	rtn (P - A) * n / denom
else 
	rtn false

P == point on plane
n == normal of plane

A == origin of ray
b == direction of ray

Cylinder:



C == center of base of cylinder
n == normal of cylinder
r == raius of cylinder
h == height of cylinder

A == origin of ray
b == direction of ray
